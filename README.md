# ReArtify
ReArtify-AI ReArtify-AI is an innovative tool designed to restore damaged paintings using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. It identifies the type of damage on an uploaded painting and applies specialized restoration processes to bring the artwork back to life.
Key Features
Damage Classification:
Utilizes a self-trained Keras classifier to determine the type of damage, categorized as:
Missing areas
Scratches
Blur
Discoloration
Smudge
No damage
Damage-Specific Repair:
Custom CNN Models: Four specialized CNN models handle restoration based on the identified damage type:
Scratches
Blur
Discoloration
Smudging
Missing Regions:
A custom mask generator combines detection, dilation, and erosion techniques to prepare damaged areas for repair.
Stability AI's Stable Diffusion Inpainting 2.0 model restores missing regions with remarkable accuracy.

Process Example
Uploaded Image: The input painting was analyzed to determine the damage type.
Damage Classification: The classifier identified the damage correctly
Repair: The corresponding CNN model repaired the image with the displayed results.
Inpainting Results
The grid below showcases the results of the inpainting process, where missing regions in the damaged painting are restored using Stable Diffusion Inpainting 2.0.

Explanation
Input Image: The damaged painting with missing regions, representation of missing reigon given by user through the UI. Any part the user determines to be missing, they can cover in color #ffffff through the UI.
Mask Generation: A basic mask is created representing the areas of the painting with color #ffffff
Mask Processing: The mask is then passed through a dynamic dilation and erosion algorithm, allowing area outside the missing area to be covered. This is done to give the model context about the painting it's supposed to inpaint.
Restoration: Missing regions are restored with fine detail using the inpainting model.
Observations
Model Used: Stability AI's Stable Diffusion Inpainting 2.0.
Result Accuracy: The restored regions blend seamlessly with the surrounding image.
Evaluations
CNN models
Evaluations of the quality were carried out via 4 metrics: PSNR, FID, SSIM, MSE, for an overall view of the model's quality performance.

Model	PSNR	FID	SSIM	MSE
Blur	20.93	31.53	0.613	0.011
Discolored	23.52	10.07	0.775	0.005
Scratches	25.21	14.49	0.861	0.004
Smudged	19.65	14.53	0.601	0.011
Keras Classifier
We plotted the confidence scores for multiple damage types, and checked accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and plotted a confusion matrix. During our training the best model achieved an accuracy of 0.9822 and the L1 loss came to be 0.046

Installation and Setup
To reduce repository size:

Frontend Dependencies:
The node_modules folder has been removed.
Install necessary frontend dependencies using:
cd frontend
npm install
Stable Diffusion Inpainting Model:
The Stability AI inpainting model is not included in this repository.
Download the model and place it in the models/inpainting folder.
Use the provided download script:
models/backup-models-and-codes/inpainting-model-downloader.ipynb
Usage
Run the project using: Launch.bat
Follow the on-screen instructions to upload a damaged painting and view the restoration results.
Dependencies
Frontend: Install modules using package.json.
Backend and Models:
Keras for damage classification.
Stability AI's Stable Diffusion Inpainting 2.0 for missing regions.
Custom CNN models for specific damage types.
How It Works
Upload Painting: Users upload an image of the damaged painting.
Classification: The Keras classifier identifies the type of damage.
Restoration:
If the damage is scratches, blur, discoloration, or smudging, the corresponding CNN model repairs the image.
For missing areas, the mask generator prepares the image, and the inpainting model restores the regions.
Result: The restored painting is displayed or saved.
Notes
Ensure that the inpainting model and dependencies are properly set up before running the application.
Refer to the download script for obtaining required external models.
Future Enhancements
Improved damage classification for multi-type damages.
Additional models to address new types of painting damage.
Enhanced user interface for better accessibility.
We hope you enjoy using ReArtify-AI to bring damaged artwork back to life! ðŸ˜Š
